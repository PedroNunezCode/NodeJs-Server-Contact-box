# NodeJs-Server-Contact-box
I used handlebars and express to make a contact form that send the contents of a form to an email. 

To use this yourself you have to have Nodemailer which you can install with npm. (npm install nodemailer-express-handlebars).
To initialize Nodemailer make a variable and equal it to it being required. (var mailer = require('nodemailer').

Handle bars was also used for this project. To intall handle bars, (npm install --save handlebars).
To include hanlde bars (require('handlebars');).

Nodemon is a helpfull tool that refreshes the application without the need of you doing (npm install -g nodemon)
To execute nodemon type the following in the command line (nodemon app.js) app.js is the file you need to execute.
